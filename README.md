# Simple-City
An Incremental City Builder

- WASD to move
- Click to build
- Grow or die
- You're never too big to fail

A patently unfun take on city building. Designed to look like a strange blend between SimCity 4 and SimCity 2013.

Made with love of SimCity, Candybox, and for DMGY-6153: Game Studio with animations made in DMUY-3133: 3D Animation at NYU School of Engineering.
